/**
 * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two
 * baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is
 * that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 *
 * <p>You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick
 * one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third
 * fruit type.
 *
 * <p>Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
 *
 * <p>Output: 3
 *
 * <p>Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C',
 * 'A', 'C']
